## Hey, I'm Teddy Klaytman ðŸ‘‹
My name is Teddy and I'm a junior Full-Stack developer.
I've been immersed in the world of software development for about a year now, and I absolutely love it!
For me, software development offers a perfect balance of problem solving and creativity.
This field has endless opportunity for growth and development and countless technologies to master
which makes it a perfect fit for a nerd like me.
